This is the Shape.Net custom mapping control for .Net.  In this folder is the
SDNMapControl.dll which is the Shape.Net custom control itself, and GIS.dll 
which contains the core of Shape.Net.  The GIS.dll library can be used by itself
without SDNMapControl if needed, but SDNMapControl *REQUIRES* GIS.dll be in the 
same directory or registered in the GAC.
