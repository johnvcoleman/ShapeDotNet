1.  Don't move viewport on layer add or remove. (Erwin)
2.  Allow feature labels to be shown without showing the feature itself. (Erwin)
3.  .dbf locking problem is fixed. (finally, right?) (Erwin & Ryan)
4.  Added LayerName property to the IMapLayer interface. (Ryan)
5.  MapCanvas property is now public in the MapControl (Erwin)
6.  Added a public property to the MapControl that accesses the underlying 
GIS.Map object of the control. (Erwin)
7.  Handle insertion of a layer properly (Ryan)
8.  Made significant changes to Map.CalculateExtents() as a result of #1 and #7.
9.  Made significant changes to the MapControl properties as a result of #6.
10.  Made the MapMetrics object public. (Ryan)

Thanks go to Ryan and Erwin for all the good feedback.  I anticipate there being 
one more beta release after this one that will deal almost entirely with improving
the query facilities. Please note that my email address has changed, and the 
k5jvc.com domain has been parked temporarily.

* v1.0.0-BETA 1 - 8 Jan 04
Fixed improper redraw on query.  Fixed inoperative query for point type Shapfiles.
Moved the method that calculates the distance from a point to a feature from the 
RectangleD class to the VectorFeature class.  Added in some requested overloaded 
methods for the Map constructor and AddFile.  Added some sample Shapefiles to the 
installer and updated the docs.  This is the first BETA release in preparation for
v1.0.

* v0.9.1 - 3 Jan 04
Fixed a bug that was causing SDN to crash on reading large polygon Shapefiles the 
first time.  Fixed some typos.

v0.9.0 - 24 Dec 03
Added in options to control the background of the labels and to outline the
background with the label forecolor.  Did some more fine tuning on the placement
of labels.  Fixed the polygon rendering to more closely match the behavior that's
called for in the Shapefile spec.  As a result, overlapping polygons should now be 
drawn correctly (XOR).  Cautiously added the query code back in.  Still not working
the way I think it should, but it needs to be released so folks can "kick the tires."
Reorganized the ShapeDotNet namespace a bit so that it encompasses the GIS 
project now.  *LOTS* of API documentation!  Every method in the MapControl and GIS 
namespace should now have a description and usage info.  The documentation is 
included with the binary distribution, source distribution, and also on my 
website: http://www.k5jvc.com/sdn.  Polished up the installer a bit too.
Merry Christmas!

* v0.8.5 - 17 Sep 03
Labels on polyline type shapefiles are now rotated to match the polyline. Added 
in label collision detection for all shape types so that the labels won't overlap 
each other(only works 95% of the time). Added in opacity control for the individual layers and seperately for 
the labels. 

* v0.8.0 - 03 Sep 03
Added in label support for all layer types.  Updated the example app property
box to handle the label settings.  The labels on polylines still need some work
to get the placement just right.  Fixed crash on minimize.  Changed the behavior 
of the zoom area tool.  Query is still broken as is the antialiasing. ( Deja Vu )

* v0.7.5 - 21 Aug 03
Major reorganization of the GIS namespace and a partial rewrite.  The rewrite 
was to make it a little more friendly for the compact framework.  The threading 
went went through a bit of an overhaul as a result of the changes for the CF.  
Added in layer support and property control for each layer.  Reworked the GUI
in the example app to utilize the layering abilities of SDN.  Query is still 
broken as is the antialiasing.

* v0.7.0 - 13 Jun 03
Fixed exception being thrown when querying after a new shp is loaded 
(bounds checking).  Performance improvement that was suppose to be in 
the last version didn't materialize because of some locking issues
between threads.  Fixed.  Each thread now has its own GraphicsPath object
to draw to.  Saw a 46% improvement in rendering speed on my box as a result
(YMMV).  Added in the ability to save the current view to a bitmap image.
Added in a display of the rendering speed (upper left corner of the control).
Created some new icons for the app/control.  *MORE* aspect checking fixes.

* v0.6.5 - 6 June 03
Lots of changes in the rendering code.  Everything is (should be) thread 
friendly now.  There should be a noticable bump in performance on SMP machines
of 25-33%.  Each drawing operation gets broken down into two threads where each
thread has exactly half of the DrawList to draw.

Added in a toggle for turning the antialiasing on/off.
